🧑‍🎓 About me
=====
**Hello, I am Chunyu Zhao.👋**  
I am currently a Master's student at the [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/) (BNU), China, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Xiao](https://geot.bnu.edu.cn/Public/htm/news/5/172.html). I am a member of the [MUSES (MUltiscale Satellite remotE Sensing)](https://muses.bnu.edu.cn/) team. My research lies at the intersection of Remote Sensing, Computer Vision, and Earth Sciences.

Before joining BNU, I obtained my B.E. in Resources Prospecting Engineering (Solid Mineral Resources) in 2019 from the [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) (CUGB), China, where I graduated as an **Outstanding Graduate**. My undergraduate thesis was completed under the guidance of [Prof. Gongwen Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gongwen-Wang).

**My research interests include:**
* The intersection of Remote Sensing and Computer Vision, with a focus on image restoration and data fusion
* Deep learning-based super-resolution methods for remote sensing imagery
* Spatiotemporal reconstruction of remote sensing parameter time series (e.g., LAI and NDVI)
* Advanced deep learning techniques for geoscience and Earth observation applications, including mineral alteration information extraction
