About me
=====

**Hello, I am Chunyu Zhao.**  
I am currently a Master's student at the [Beijing Normal University](https://www.bnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Zhiqiang Xiao](https://geot.bnu.edu.cn/Public/htm/news/5/172.html). I am a member of the [MUSES (MUltiscale Satellite remotE Sensing)](https://muses.bnu.edu.cn/) team. My research lies at the intersection of Remote Sensing, Deep Learning, and Geological Sciences.

Before joining BNU, I obtained my B.E. in Resources Prospecting Engineering (Solid Mineral Resources) from the [China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://www.cugb.edu.cn/) in 2019, where I graduated as an **Outstanding Graduate**. My undergraduate thesis was completed under the guidance of [Prof. Gongwen Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gongwen-Wang).

My research interests include:
------
* Remote sensing image super-resolution  
* Time-series reconstruction of vegetation indices (LAI / NDVI)  
* Multi-source satellite data fusion (SAR and optical)  
* Deep learning methods for geoscience applications
