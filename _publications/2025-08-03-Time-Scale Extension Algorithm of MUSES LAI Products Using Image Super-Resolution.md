Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key parameter in analyzing land-atmosphere processes. Several LAI products with different spatial resolutions have been generated using physical methods, or empirical methods. However, due to the short time span of these products, it is not conducive to conducting long-term series analysis. This study designs a Time span Extension Algorithm (TEA) for these LAI products based on the deep learning image super-resolution technology. The CNN was trained using LAI data from the 5km and 1km Multiscale Satellite Remote Sensing (MUSES) LAI products for 2000-2015, and the trained neural network was used to generate 1km LAI data for 1981-1999 according to the 5 km MUSES LAI product from the same period, 5km and 1km MUSES LAI in 2016-2019 were used as verification. The training performance of the neural network achieved a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 31.27 dB, and the annual average R2 between TEA 1km and 1km MUSES LAI values reached 0.94105 in 2016 to 2019. This study demonstrated the TEA can successfully extend the time span of the 1km MUSES LAI product back to 1981. When compared to the bicubic interpolation, the TEA achieved superior performance. In the near future, the TEA will be used to extend the time span of the 500m and 250m MUSES LAI products back to 1981.
