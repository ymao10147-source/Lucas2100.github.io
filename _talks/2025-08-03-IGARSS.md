### Abstract
This study demonstrated that the **Time-Scale Extension Algorithm (TEA)** can successfully extend the time span of the 1km MUSES LAI product back to 1981. By leveraging deep learning-based image super-resolution, the TEA achieved superior performance compared to traditional bicubic interpolation, providing a more consistent and high-quality long-term LAI dataset.
